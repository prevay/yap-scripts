    "The trends.chart function allows you to chart time series of selected variables from the MtF dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes a set of parameters as its input.\n",
    "\n",
    "*varcodes* - this specifies the variable, or set of variables to be charted by its code (consult the dataset's codebook for variable codes). The format is a string of text in single or double quotes. If specifying a set of variables, separate individual codes by commas (without spaces). \n",
    "\n",
    "*measure* - What measure to use for the variables. Most variables in the dataset are measured on ordinal scales from 0 to N. These scales have different meanings based on the question being asked. This parameter is a single/double-quoted string of text where the first character can be either <, > or = and the second character is a number. For example a measure specified as '>2' means calculate and display the percentage of respondents whose answer was coded with a value higher than 2 (3 and up). A measure of '=3' means calculate and display the percentage of respondents whose answer was coded with a value of 3 (again consult the codebook to se what the codes mean for each variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "*labels* - a list of labels for the variable codes as they should appear in the chart's legend (single/double-quoted string of text separated by commas)\n",
    "\n",
    "*from_date* - year (4-digit format) where the time series should start\n",
    "\n",
    "*to_date* - year (4-digit foirmat) where the times series should end\n",
    "\n",
    "*title* - the title that should be used for the chart (single/double quoted)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of how to input the parameters and run the function:"
